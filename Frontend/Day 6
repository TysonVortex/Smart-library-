Great! Let’s implement Soft Delete today—an essential feature that lets you mark books as deleted without permanently removing them from the database.

✅ Day 6: Delete Book (Soft Delete with Confirmation)


---

🎯 Goals:

1. Add a Delete button next to the Edit button


2. On click, mark is_deleted = TRUE instead of removing the row


3. Confirm deletion with a popup


4. Books marked as deleted will not show up in the book list




---

📁 File Structure Update:

frontend/
├── view_books.php      ← Update to show Delete button
backend/
├── delete_book.php     ← New: handles soft delete


---

🧱 Step 1: Add “Delete” Button in view_books.php

Modify the Actions column inside the <td> row to:

<td>
  <a href="edit_book.php?id=<?= $row['book_id'] ?>" class="btn btn-sm btn-warning">Edit</a>
  <a href="../backend/delete_book.php?id=<?= $row['book_id'] ?>" 
     class="btn btn-sm btn-danger"
     onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this book?');">Delete</a>
</td>


---

⚙️ Step 2: Create delete_book.php in backend/

<?php
include 'db.php';

if (isset($_GET['id'])) {
    $id = $_GET['id'];

    $stmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE book SET is_deleted = TRUE WHERE book_id = ?");
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $id);

    if ($stmt->execute()) {
        header("Location: ../frontend/view_books.php?deleted=1");
        exit;
    } else {
        echo "❌ Error: " . $stmt->error;
    }

    $stmt->close();
} else {
    echo "❌ No book ID provided.";
}

$conn->close();
?>


---

✅ Optional: Show Alert After Deletion

At the top of view_books.php, under <body> and inside .container, add this code:

<?php if (isset($_GET['deleted'])): ?>
  <div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    Book deleted successfully.
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
  </div>
<?php endif; ?>


---

✅ Final Flow:

Users see Edit and Delete buttons.

Clicking Delete asks for confirmation.

If confirmed, book is soft deleted (is_deleted = TRUE).

Book disappears from list (but stays in DB for auditing).



---

📌 Deliverables for Day 6:

✅ Delete button with confirmation

✅ delete_book.php script

✅ Deletion success message (optional)

✅ Tested and verified soft delete

You now have a fully working CRUD project:
