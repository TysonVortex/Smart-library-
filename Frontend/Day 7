ititPerfect! Since you're required to include both a Client Side (students) and an Admin Side (librarian/staff), here's how we’ll divide and plan things going forward.


---

✅ Admin Side vs Client Side

Feature	Admin Side 🧑‍💼	Client Side 👨‍🎓

Add, Edit, Delete Books	✅ Yes (Full CRUD)	❌ No
Search / View All Books	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Issue/Request Books	✅ Approve/Deny requests	✅ Can request books
Login/Authentication	✅ Required (admin credentials)	✅ Required (student login/ID)
View Issued Requests	✅ See all issued/pending requests	✅ See only their own requests



---

🔧 Changes to Make Before Moving Forward

1. 🗂️ Folder Restructure

Separate the two interfaces:

/admin/
  ├── add_book.php
  ├── edit_book.php
  ├── view_books.php
  ├── delete_book.php
  └── login.php (for admin)
/client/
  ├── view_books.php
  ├── request_book.php
  ├── login.php (for student)


---

2. 🔑 Login System (Minimal)

We'll add simple session-based login for both roles:

Admin: Hardcoded login (for simplicity)

Client: Login with student ID (optional validation)


We'll create:

admin/login.php — Admin enters username/password

client/login.php — Student enters ID/Name to log in


And protect pages with:

session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['admin_logged_in'])) {
  header("Location: login.php");
  exit;
}


---

3. ✅ Restrict Actions

Admin pages can show Edit/Delete buttons.

Client pages will only allow:

Viewing books

Searching

Requesting to issue a book




---

4. 📋 Create a Book Request System

Client side can request a book:

A requests table will store: request_id, student_name, book_id, status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)


Admin can then:

View all requests

Approve or reject them



---

🧩 What to Do Next?

Let’s finalize the basic admin-client structure in this order:

👉 Step Plan:

1. ✅ Split view_books.php into:

/admin/view_books.php (with Edit/Delete)

/client/view_books.php (readonly + request button)



2. ✅ Add basic session-based login for both


3. 🆕 Add "Request Book" feature for clients


4. 🆕 Add "Approve/Reject Requests" panel for admin




---

Let me know and I’ll begin with Step 1: Splitting the code into Admin and Client folders + removing admin actions from client side view. Shall I proceed with that?

Great point! You're being methodical—which is exactly how a good developer works.

Let’s adapt your existing SmartLibraryProject/ structure to support Admin Side and Client Side while keeping things clean and logical.

✅ Updated Folder Structure with Admin and Client Areas

🔄 Summary of What We’re Doing:

Folder	Purpose

admin/	Interface and actions for admin (CRUD, approvals)
client/	Interface for student login, book view, and request
backend/	PHP logic for form actions (inserts, updates, login, etc.)
docs/	Requirement and planning documentation
database/	SQL schema for tables like book, users, requests



---

✅ Next Steps:

Now that we’ve established this structure:

➤ Do you want me to help:

🔐 Create the login system (admin & client) first?
OR

🧩 Start separating the current pages into /admin and /client folders?


Let me know your preference, and I’ll begin that next step for you.



Awesome! Welcome to Day 7 — today we officially split your project into Admin and Client sides using the structure we planned.


---

✅ Day 7: Separate Admin & Client Interfaces


---

🎯 Today’s Goals:

1. Move & clean up your view_books.php into:

/admin/view_books.php with Edit/Delete buttons

/client/view_books.php with search only and a Request Book button



2. Setup basic folder layout


3. Verify both sides show their correct version




---

🧱 Step 1: Create Folders

In your project root, create two folders:

/admin
/client

> You can move the working view_books.php into /admin/view_books.php first.




---

🛠 Step 2: Create /admin/view_books.php

Move your existing file (view_books.php with search + edit/delete buttons) into /admin/.
✅ No changes needed for now — admin sees full controls.


---

🆕 Step 3: Create /client/view_books.php

Create a new version of the page for students — it removes Edit/Delete buttons, but keeps Search and adds a "Request Book" button.


---

✅ /client/view_books.php (clean version for students)

<?php
include '../backend/db.php';

$search = '';
if (isset($_GET['search'])) {
    $search = trim($_GET['search']);
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM book WHERE is_deleted = FALSE AND 
            (title LIKE ? OR author LIKE ? OR isbn LIKE ?)";
    $searchParam = "%$search%";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->bind_param("sss", $searchParam, $searchParam, $searchParam);
} else {
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM book WHERE is_deleted = FALSE";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
}

$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
?>

      <?php endif; ?>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
</body>
</html>

<?php
$stmt->close();
$conn->close();
?>

✅ What You Achieved Today:

✅ Created /admin/ and /client/ folders

✅ Moved old view_books.php to Admin side (with edit/delete)

✅ Made a new Client view with Request Book action

✅ Pages work independently



---

📦 Deliverables for Day 7:

✅ Admin can still manage books

✅ Client can search and request books

✅ Project is now modular and maintainable



---

🔜 Next Step — Day 8 Plan:

Add Book Request System

Client will use request_book.php to send a request

Admin will use view_requests.php to approve/reject


Shall we proceed with Day 8: Request Book System?
