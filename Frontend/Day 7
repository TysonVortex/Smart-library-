Perfect! Since you're required to include both a Client Side (students) and an Admin Side (librarian/staff), here's how we’ll divide and plan things going forward.


---

✅ Admin Side vs Client Side

Feature	Admin Side 🧑‍💼	Client Side 👨‍🎓

Add, Edit, Delete Books	✅ Yes (Full CRUD)	❌ No
Search / View All Books	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Issue/Request Books	✅ Approve/Deny requests	✅ Can request books
Login/Authentication	✅ Required (admin credentials)	✅ Required (student login/ID)
View Issued Requests	✅ See all issued/pending requests	✅ See only their own requests



---

🔧 Changes to Make Before Moving Forward

1. 🗂️ Folder Restructure

Separate the two interfaces:

/admin/
  ├── add_book.php
  ├── edit_book.php
  ├── view_books.php
  ├── delete_book.php
  └── login.php (for admin)
/client/
  ├── view_books.php
  ├── request_book.php
  ├── login.php (for student)


---

2. 🔑 Login System (Minimal)

We'll add simple session-based login for both roles:

Admin: Hardcoded login (for simplicity)

Client: Login with student ID (optional validation)


We'll create:

admin/login.php — Admin enters username/password

client/login.php — Student enters ID/Name to log in


And protect pages with:

session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['admin_logged_in'])) {
  header("Location: login.php");
  exit;
}


---

3. ✅ Restrict Actions

Admin pages can show Edit/Delete buttons.

Client pages will only allow:

Viewing books

Searching

Requesting to issue a book




---

4. 📋 Create a Book Request System

Client side can request a book:

A requests table will store: request_id, student_name, book_id, status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)


Admin can then:

View all requests

Approve or reject them



---

🧩 What to Do Next?

Let’s finalize the basic admin-client structure in this order:

👉 Step Plan:

1. ✅ Split view_books.php into:

/admin/view_books.php (with Edit/Delete)

/client/view_books.php (readonly + request button)



2. ✅ Add basic session-based login for both


3. 🆕 Add "Request Book" feature for clients


4. 🆕 Add "Approve/Reject Requests" panel for admin

Let me know and I’ll begin with Step 1: Splitting the code into Admin and Client folders + removing admin actions from client side view. Shall I proceed with that?
